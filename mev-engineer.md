Interested in arbitrage trading, liquidations, sandwiches, front-runner exploitation, and other forms of new alpha?

Want to be doing cool and exciting stuff every day building money-printing machines with a like-minded group of traders?

DeFi is a dark forest and we are the sharks who hunt within it. We are looking for MEV engineers to be part of our growing team, to expand our current batch of strategies and find new alpha. We are already actively trading multiple profitable strategies in the market and we are now expanding with the singular aim of total domination of all MEV.

- Passion for building trading strategies and money-printing machines
- High degree of intelligence, we work on difficult problems and we face off against highly-skilled adversaries. We are looking for the best and the brightest
- Ability to think clearly and code quickly under pressure. MEV trading is a high-stakes game and we often need to move fast

### Nice to have
- Smart contract development experience
- A history of doing cool and difficult stuff

### Benefits
- Competitive full-time salary as a base wage, or percentage of profits from strategies you help develop (whichever is higher)
- Percentage of profits increases with the size of the profits. Make more money for the project = get a higher split
- Equity in company
- Work from any timezone, anywhere (as long as you get results)
- Learn a unique and competitive skillset
